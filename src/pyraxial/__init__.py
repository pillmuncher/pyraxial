"""
An algebraic take on axis-aligned rectangles.

This module aims to simplify working with bounding boxes.


It defines the class Rect with the following methods and attributes:
  - Two binary operators | ("join") and & ("meet").
  - Two identity elements with respect to | and &, Rect.EMPTY and Rect.PLANE.
  - Two polyadic class methods Rect.enclose(rects) and Rect.overlap(rects)
    as generalizations of | and & over arbitrary numbers of rectangles.
  - A set of operators that define containment relations between rectangles.
  - A class method Rect.closed_regions(rects) that computes the bounding boxes
    for all subsets of "transitively" overlapping rectangles in a given set of
    rectangles.


The Rect class together with the | and & operations and the identity elements
forms a complete lattice so that for all Rect objects a, b and c the following
laws hold:


Identity Elements:

    a | Rect.EMPTY  ==  a
    a & Rect.PLANE  ==  a


Absorbing Elements:

    a | Rect.PLANE  ==  Rect.PLANE
    a & Rect.EMPTY  ==  Rect.EMPTY


Idempotency:

    a | a  ==  a
    a & a  ==  a


Commutativity:

    a | b  ==  b | a
    a & b  ==  b & a


Associativity:

    (a | b) | c  ==  a | (b | c)
    (a & b) & c  ==  a & (b & c)


Absorption:

    a | (a & b)  ==  a
    a & (a | b)  ==  a


Since these laws already define a partially ordered set, the following laws also
hold:


Least Element:

    Rect.EMPTY â‰¦ a


Greatest Element:

    a â‰¦ Rect.PLANE


Reflexivity:

    a â‰¦ a


Transitivity:

    a â‰¦ b  and  b â‰¦ c   ðŸ¡’   a â‰¦ c


Antisymmetry:

    a â‰¦ b  and  b â‰¦ a   ðŸ¡˜   a = b


Monotonicity:

    a1 â‰¦ a2  and  b1 â‰¦ b2   ðŸ¡’   a1 | b1  â‰¦  a2 | b2
    a1 â‰¦ a2  and  b1 â‰¦ b2   ðŸ¡’   a1 & b1  â‰¦  a2 & b2


Semidistributivity:

    (a & b) | (a & c)  â‰¦  a & (b | c)
    a | (b & c)  â‰¦  (a | b) & (a | c)


Notice the absence of the laws of distribution and modularity.


A rectangle is created like so:

    r = Rect(box)

where box is an already existing Rect object, tuple, list, iterator or other
iterable, provided it is either empty or contains/yields four numbers that
denote the left, top, right and bottom coordinates (in that order). Otherwise,
a ValueError is raised.

Coordinate values increase from left to right and from top to bottom.  Therefor,
if left â‰¦ right and top â‰¦ bottom the resulting rectangle will be a Rect with the
specified coordinates.  If left > right or top > bottom the resulting rectangle
will equal Rect.EMPTY.

Rect objects are immutable and the properties have no setters.

All method results are covariant under subtyping.

Rect() and closed_regions() accept any type of iterable.  The operators however
work reliably only on sequence-like objects, but not iterators.  If you pass an
iterator as an argument, the behavior will be undefined, probably raising an
exception, or worse, causing inexplicably wrong results.

Rects can be used as a drop-in in contexts where axis-aligned rectangles are
represented by 4-tuples, like e.g. Pillow's Image.crop() method. For contexts
where such rectangles are represented as pairs of point coordinates the class
method Rect.from_points() and the Rect.points property can be used.


See API documentation here:

https://pillmuncher.github.io/pyraxial


Here are some usage examples:

>>> from pyraxial import Rect

>>> a = Rect((1, 2, 3, 4))

>>> a.left, a.top, a.right, a.bottom
(1, 2, 3, 4)

>>> a.points
((1, 2), (3, 4))

>>> a.width, a.height
(2, 2)

>>> b = Rect((2, 3, 4, 5))

>>> a | b
Rect((1, 2, 4, 5))

>>> a & b
Rect((2, 3, 3, 4))

>>> a & Rect.EMPTY == Rect.EMPTY
True

>>> a | Rect.PLANE == Rect.PLANE
True

>>> a | Rect.EMPTY == a & Rect.PLANE == a
True

>>> rects = [Rect((1, 2, 3, 4)), Rect((2, 3, 4, 5)), Rect((3, 4, 5, 6))]

>>> Rect.enclose(*rects)
Rect((1, 2, 5, 6))

>>> Rect.overlap(*rects)
Rect((3, 4, 3, 4))

>>> Rect.enclose(Rect.EMPTY, *rects) == Rect.enclose(*rects)
True

>>> Rect.enclose(Rect.PLANE, *rects) == Rect.PLANE
True

>>> Rect.overlap(Rect.EMPTY, *rects) == Rect.EMPTY
True

>>> Rect.overlap(Rect.PLANE, *rects) == Rect.overlap(*rects)
True

>>> rects += [Rect((7, 8, 8, 9)), Rect((8, 7, 9, 8))]

>>> set(Rect.closed_regions(rects)) == set(
...    [Rect((1, 2, 5, 6)), Rect((7, 7, 9, 9))])
